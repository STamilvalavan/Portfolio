      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Tamilvalavan</strong>, an aspiring <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> with a keen interest in <strong>cybersecurity</strong> and <strong>cloud computing</strong>. I have a strong foundation in web development, with hands-on experience in building modern web applications using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>React</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my internships at <strong>VDart</strong> and <strong>Codebind Technologies</strong>, I worked on live projects such as <strong>Document Management Systems</strong>. These experiences have honed my skills in both frontend and backend development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am diving deeper into <strong>cloud computing</strong> while also working on my final year projectâ€”an <strong>IoT-based autonomous solution</strong> for public toilet maintenance. My passion for <strong>cybersecurity</strong> drives me to explore ways to secure digital systems, automate security tasks, and enhance data protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am always eager to <strong>learn</strong>, <strong>innovate</strong>, and <strong>contribute</strong> to projects that make an impact. I am looking forward to opportunities where I can leverage my skills and grow in the <strong>cybersecurity</strong> and <strong>cloud computing</strong> domains!
